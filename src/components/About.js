                    As a recent graduate of Oregon State University Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science through their Ecampus,
                    I am familiar with working and developing software remotely, meeting deadlines, and collaboration and communication
                    tools.  Additionally, with my bachelor's degree in physics, I am well prepared to dive deep and tackle complex and
                    difficult problems and strive for an intuitive understanding of the data.  My employment history consists of many
                    opportunities where team dynamics and communication were critical, so future employers can also expect the same.
